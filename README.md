# Npc Marker
This plugin is a utility for allowing players to easily recognise which NPCs they have applied venom to. Although made for efficient Nex kc,
it can also be useful for slayer and other PVM. When a hotkey is pressed, it will cause newly spawned NPCs to be marked. When an NPC has venom
applied to it, it will be unmarked. This is helpful for getting Nex kc, as you can easily see which monsters in the area you still need to inflict venom upon, as well as being useful in many other multicombat situations. 

Additionally, there is a bug where venomed NPCs that have lost aggression towards a player can not be
revenomed. This plugin would help recognising those NPCs.
